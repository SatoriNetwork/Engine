arima (classical, linear)
xgboost
deep learning approaches
transformsers

combinations

Major classes of time series prediction
A. ARIMA (classical time series - linear)
B. XGBost (or as Jerome recommends combinations of classical time series and XGBoost)
C. Deep learning approaches (Jerome is not an expert on LLMs or generative AI)
Other deep learning approaches for time series prediction.
a) Recurrent neural network (one can argue that some of the other approaches fit into this)
b) Convolutional Neural Networks
c) LSTM
d) Transformers

here we can use jupyter notebooks to explore how to make these/this pipeline, focusing on xgboost to start.

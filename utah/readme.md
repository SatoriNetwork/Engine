goal: automated timeseries prediction ppipline creation

here we can use jupyter notebooks to explore how to make these/this pipeline, focusing on xgboost to start.

sklearn piplines
extract trends, cycles, xgboost, noise

+ other kinds of pipelines (pytorch etc.)

lstm
arima (classical, linear)
xgboost
deep learning approaches
transformsers

combinations

sklearn + keras (possible standarization)

Major classes of time series prediction
A. ARIMA (classical time series - linear)
B. XGBost (or as Jerome recommends combinations of classical time series and XGBoost)
C. Deep learning approaches (Jerome is not an expert on LLMs or generative AI)
Other deep learning approaches for time series prediction.
a) Recurrent neural network (one can argue that some of the other approaches fit into this)
b) Convolutional Neural Networks
c) LSTM
d) Transformers

This examples using Sklearn for the API, pandas for the data structures, and keras for the deep learning algorithm libraries.
Not open source. This is a shared Jupyter notebook that can be downloaded and tested locally on Jupyter, without cost. If the concepts are good, we can create our own comparable version from scratch using their approach, not their source code.
